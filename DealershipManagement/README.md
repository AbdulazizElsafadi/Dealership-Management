## Core Entities

- **User**: Represents a system user (customer or admin).

  - `Id` (int): Primary key
  - `FullName` (string)
  - `Email` (string, unique)
  - `PasswordHash` (string)
  - `Role` (enum): User role (Admin, Customer)
  - `CreatedAt` (DateTime)

- **Vehicle**: Represents a car in the inventory.

  - `Id` (int): Primary key
  - `Make` (string)
  - `Model` (string)
  - `Year` (int)
  - `Price` (decimal)
  - `Color` (string)
  - `Mileage` (int)
  - `Description` (string)
  - `IsAvailable` (bool)
  - `CreatedAt` (DateTime)

- **Purchase**: Represents a vehicle purchase request/transaction.

  - `Id` (int): Primary key
  - `UserId` (int): Foreign key to User
  - `VehicleId` (int): Foreign key to Vehicle
  - `PurchaseDate` (DateTime)
  - `PriceAtPurchase` (decimal)
  - `Status` (enum): Purchase status
  - `ProcessedByAdminId` (int?, nullable): Admin who processed the purchase

- **OtpCode**: Represents a one-time password for sensitive actions.
  - `Id` (int): Primary key
  - `UserId` (int): Foreign key to User
  - `Code` (string)
  - `Purpose` (string)
  - `ExpiresAt` (DateTime)
  - `IsUsed` (bool)
  - `CreatedAt` (DateTime)

---

## ðŸ§  Design Decisions & Assumptions

- OTP verification is handled in two steps (request and verify) for cleaner separation of concerns.
- Vehicles are treated as unique items (no quantity); sold vehicles are marked IsAvailable = false.
- OTPs are purpose-specific (Register, Login, etc.) and cannot be reused across different actions.

## Getting Started

### Clone and Run the App

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulazizElsafadi/Dealership-Management.git
   cd "DealershipManagement"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Create the database**

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Database Details (SQLite)**

   - The application uses a local **SQLite** database by default.
   - The database file is named `dealership.db` and is located in the `DealershipManagement` directory.
   - The default connection string can be found and modified in `appsettings.json`:

     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=dealership.db"
     }
     ```

   - If you wish to connect to a different SQLite file or use another database provider, update the `DefaultConnection` value in `DealershipManagement/appsettings.json` accordingly.
   - You can use any SQLite client (such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)) to open and inspect the `dealership.db` file.

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

6. **Access the API**
   - API: `https://localhost:5220`
   - Swagger UI: `https://localhost:5220/swagger`
